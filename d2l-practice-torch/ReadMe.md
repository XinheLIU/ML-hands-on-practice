## Description

This repository contains implementations of deep learning concepts from the "Dive into Deep Learning" course. The code is organized into:

1. **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various deep learning concepts
   - Attention mechanisms
   - Convolutional Neural Networks and Pooling operations

2. **Source Code**: Modular implementation of core components
   - Data loading and processing utilities
   - Model implementations and training frameworks
   - Helper functions and visualization tools

The implementations use PyTorch as the deep learning framework.
